            <h3>What is a Pulmonary Embolism?</h3>
            <p class="align-left reveal-type info-para">PE is a life-threatening condition in which a blood clot - an embolus originating and
                travelling from a thrombosed deep vein (DVT) blocks one or more of the pulmonary
                arteries impairing the oxygenation of the blood by the lungs. Symptoms include
                sudden breathing difficulty, coughing up blood, and chest pain. Larger emboli can
                potentially cause strain on the right ventricle due to resistance to pumping blood and
                could potentially result in a fatal, sudden cardiac arrest.

            <h3 class="align-right">Our solution</h3>
            <p class="reveal-type info-para align-right">We’ve developed a lightweight, portable microwave imaging vest as a fast, affordable alternative to costly CTPA scans for diagnosing pulmonary embolism. The vest serves as a simple point-of-care (POCT) device that can allow for early, accessible detection of Pulmonary Embolism (PE) without ionising radiation or delays - this would ultimately improve outcomes for both patients and doctors, revolutionsing lung imaging. In emergency settings, where every minute is crucial, increasing the speed of diagnoses would turn lost time into saved lives. As well as this, missed or delayed diagnoses can be fatal; in primary care settings, atypical presentations of PE are often missed - our device would aim to combat this issue, offering GPs a more advanced diagnostic tool kit to make referrals easier.  </p>

            <h2>So,<br> how does PULMAVEST<sup>TM</sup> work?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="how-vest-works-2">
            <p>
                Microwaves emitted by a set of antennae placed around the vest are scattered due to the tissue’s dielectric properties. Clot tissue, oedema and lack of perfusion - localised signs of PE - all lead to distinctive changes in the dielectric properties of the parenchyma. The Vector Network Analyser (VNA) gives microwave absorption, transmission and reflection values, which are then used to calculate the tissue's dielectric constant via an AI based software. These values are used to construct the scattering matrix. Colour-coded images are formed from data by tomographic reconstruction algorithms with comparison to a ‘phantom’ model of healthy lungs. AI based algorithms with Machine Learning detects the presence and location of the clot.
