            <h3 class="reveal-type">What is a Pulmonary Embolism?</h3>
            <p class="align-left reveal-type info-para">PE is a life-threatening condition in which a blood clot - an embolus originating and
                travelling from a thrombosed deep vein (DVT) blocks one or more of the pulmonary
                arteries impairing the oxygenation of the blood by the lungs. Symptoms include
                sudden breathing difficulty, coughing up blood, and chest pain. Larger emboli can
                potentially cause strain on the right ventricle due to resistance to pumping blood and
                could potentially result in a fatal, sudden cardiac arrest.

            <h3 class="reveal-type align-right"> The Problem</h3>
            <p class="align-right reveal-type">
                There are over 10 million cases of DVT and PE diagnosed globally per year. In England, 35,845 hospital admissions for PE were reported between 2022
                and 2023. Moreover, among patients that die in intensive care and undergo autopsy, 37.9% were found to have PE that was missed. PE is a difficult condition to diagnose clinically, due to similarities in presentation with other conditions. Common findings (e.g. low blood oxygen saturation,
                increased heart rate) are non-specific to PE. Clinical scoring systems, such as the Wells criteria, have low specificity and lead to unnecessary imaging. PE may
                not be considered in patients who are without classical risk factors, which can ultimately augment the probability of missed diagnoses of spontaneous PE in
                young, healthy patients.

            <h3 class="reveal-type align-right">Our solution</h3>
            <p class="reveal-type info-para align-right">We’ve developed a lightweight, portable microwave imaging vest as a fast, affordable alternative to costly CTPA scans for diagnosing pulmonary embolism. Designed for point-of-care use, it enables early detection without ionising radiation, specialist input, or delays — improving outcomes and reducing risk for both patients and clinicians.  Missed or delayed diagnoses can be fatal; our vest helps catch life-threatening clots sooner, when every minute counts. By making advanced diagnostics more accessible, we’re turning lost time into saved lives. </p>

            <h2>So,<br> how does PULMAVEST<sup>TM</sup> work?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="how-vest-works-2">
            <p>
                Microwaves are emitted by a set of antennae placed around the vest and are subsequently scattered due to the tissue dielectric properties. 
Clot tissue, oedema and lack of perfusion - localised signs of PE - all lead to changes in the dielectric properties of the parenchyma. 
The Vector Network Analyser (VNA) gives microwave absorption, transmission and reflection values, which are then used to calculate the tissue's dielectric constant via an AI based software. These values are used to construct the scattering matrix.
Colour-coded images are formed from data by tomographic reconstruction algorithms with comparison to a ‘phantom’ model of healthy lungs.
AI based algorithm with Machine Learning detects the presence and location of the pulmonary embolism.
